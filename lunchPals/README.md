# Lunch Pals
## Meet New People And Explore New Places
LunchPals is an easy and convenient way to connect you with other likeminded people and explore new and exciting places. Focusing on students first we enable you to meet new friends when moving to new campuses and exploring your current campus. The first release of LunchPals will be on android, but don't worry: iOs is on it's way! 

LunchPals also wants you to be able to find matches safely. To allow this we are only matching at public places and will allow you to rate each person you share a meal with.
